# 1. Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.
- A: Relational Database Management System is a paradigm that manages databases using tables. Structured Query Language is the communication we use to communicate with data within that management system. 

# 2. Why do tables need a `primary key`?
- A: Tables require a primary key to identify unique entries, keeping the tables streamlined with relevant data that are not repeating. 

# 3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
- A: We call this column the foreign key.

# 4. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
- A: To have this kind of relationship, we use a third table that references the original two tables using composite keys.
